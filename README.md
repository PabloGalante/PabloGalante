I started my journey in technology as a developer (JS, TS, React, Next, and Node), but soon realized that what truly resonated with me was thinking about the bigger picture. That shift led me into the cloud world, where I found the space to combine the technical with the strategic.

Today, I’m a Cloud Engineer, leading regional projects with global impact.

I work with Google Cloud to design scalable infrastructure, Terraform as IaC to automate deployments, and GitHub Actions with DevOps practices to integrate CI/CD in distributed environments.

I have experience in event-driven data system architectures and building ETL pipelines using Go as my preferred (and personal favorite) language, as well as in web application platforms, monitoring systems, among others.

What I enjoy most is simplifying complex systems so they feel simple, and designing solutions that not only work today but are self-sustaining, resilient, and scalable.

I thrive working flexibly, autonomously, and always in collaboration. The real difference doesn’t come from one person alone, but from the whole team.
